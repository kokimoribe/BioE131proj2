************UPSTREAM/PROMOTER*************
-35 seq					"TTGACA"
-10 seq (Pribnow box)	"TATAAT"
Shine-Dalgarno			"AGGAGG" (mRNA, see Notes below)

Notes: 
-	Shine-Dalgarno sequence is a ribosomal binding site in prokaryotic mRNA, generally 
	located around 8 bases upstream of the start codon AUG. (wikipedia)

-	For design purposes, the gene to be transcribed begins at the Transcription 
	Start Site (TSS), exactly 10 nucleotides in the 3' direction from the start 
	of the Pribnow box. 

-	Ensure that your DNA sequence contains a Pribnow box (specifically the sequence TATAAT)
	starting at the -10 position. The composition of the -35 sequence can have more flexibility 
	in terms of composition and position. 
******************************************



**************THE RIBO-SWITCH**************
-	There must be a riboswitch such that (at room temperature) the Shine-Dalgarno sequence 
	will only be exposed if the effector sequence is present.

-	Assume that for an effector to successfully bind, its exact complement or reverse complement 
	has to be present in the sequence.

-	It's sufficient for a single nucleotide of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence to be base-paired
	for it to be considered inaccessible. All six nucleotides of the Shine-Dalgarno sequence
	must be non-base-paired for it to be considered accessible (a non-base-paired SD sequence
	that is exposed in the loop region of a stem-loop is considered accessible).
*******************************************


*********PROTEIN-ENCODING REGION**********

---PART 1: AMINO ACID SEQUENCE---
-	The most conserved/variable sites in the alignment represented by protein.fasta should correspond 
	to the most conserved/variable sites in the output.
-	S / (sequence length), the length-normalized total column entropy in an alignment of all your encoded 
	protein sequences (rewarding diversity in your generated protein sequences).
-	-M, a penalty term based on the maximum percentage identity between any one of your proteins and any
	protein from protein.fasta (rewarding generation of new sequences, rather than exact copies of the
	sequence in that file).
-	L / (sequence length), the length-normalized total log-likelihood of all your protein sequences using
	a position-specific weight matrix model based on the alignment in protein.fasta (rewarding identification
	of the conserved/variable sites).
---------------------------------


---PART 2: DNA CODON SEQUENCE---
-	The DNA sequence must be in LOWER case, EXCEPT for the start and stop codons which must be in UPPER case.
-	The relative codon usage for each amino acid should match the frequency table as closely as possible.
-	Î”CodonFreq, the difference between the codon's frequency in your output sequence and the target frequency,
	averaged across all codons (rewarding correct codon usage).
--------------------------------
******************************************



***********INTRINSIC TERMINATOR***********
-	Ensure that your intrinsic terminator is composed of a CG-rich hairpin loop (at-least 4 base-pairs) followed by
	a poly-U tail (composed of at-least 8 sequential Uracil nucleotides). For the purposes of this project,
	transcription will be terminated immediately after the end of the 8+ Uracil nucleotides.
******************************************



*******SEQ CHECKS AND MODIFICATIONS*******
-	if multiple complement or reverse complement sequences occur throughout the entire length of the sequence (even
	within the coding region), we assume the effector binds to them and those nucleotides are completely unavailable 
	for base-pairing.

-	Check for Restriction sites and their reverse complement.

-	Identical codons, or synonymous codons differing only at the third position, should be spaced
	apart as much as possible.
	Avg Space between similar codons) / (sequence length), the average space between identical/synonymous codons, 
	averaged for all codons and divided by sequence length (rewarding avoidance of repeat codons).

-	Check output.fasta is valid FASTA format, if not valid, no further points awarded.
